|Docs: how: for common use cases X,Y,Z mini-tutorials showing worked examples on how to do X,Y,Z|3|https://github.com/CSC510-Group-25/CSC510_Group25_Project1/blob/main/docs/DemoScript.docx|
|Docs: why: docs tell a story, motivate the whole thing, deliver a punchline that makes you want to rush out and use the thing|3|https://github.com/CSC510-Group-25/CSC510_Group25_Project1|
|Docs: short video, animated, hosted on your repo. That convinces people why they want to work on your code.|3|https://github.com/CSC510-Group-25/CSC510_Group25_Project1#readme|

| Chat channel: exists||
| test cases:.a large proportion of the issues related to handling failing cases.||if a test case fails, open an issue and fix it|
| evidence that the whole team is using the same tools: everyone can get to all tools and files||
| evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. config files in the repo, updated by lots of different people)||
| evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. tutor can ask anyone to share screen, they demonstrate the system running on their computer)||
| evidence that the members of the team are working across multiple places in the code base||
|short release cycles || (hard to see in short projects) project members are committing often enough so that everyone can get your work|
