# How to Contribute?

## Reporting Bugs
This section guides you through submitting a bug report. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports.

### How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?
Bugs are tracked as GitHub issues. After you've determined which repository your bug is related to, create an issue on that repository and provide the following information by filling in the template.

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

* Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the problem.
* Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem in as many details as possible. For example, start by explaining how you started, e.g. which command exactly you used in the terminal. When listing steps, don't just say what you did, but explain how you did it. For example, if you moved the cursor to the end of a line, explain if you used the mouse, or a keyboard shortcut, and if so which one?
* Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples.
